      <description>A lot has been written about Thomas Grønnemark’s appointment as Liverpool’s throw-in coach. In this post I will try to dig a little bit deeper and consult the numbers to see if I can seperate the myths from the facts and if I can unearth something that hasn’t been written before. I will start with summarizing what I have read so far. As probably many of you I haven’t given throw-ins much thought except for the occasional view on the time they take (mostly too long because my team is behind, the game is always over and the all the ball boys seem to have vanished).</description>
