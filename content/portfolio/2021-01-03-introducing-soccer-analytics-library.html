<p>As many year-end Twitter threads have highlighted: 2020 was a great year for soccer analytics. New open-sourced data sets have enabled a new wave of amateur content, while ever more sophisticated research is published by clubs, data providers and universities around the world.</p>
<p>Having followed the space for a few years now it becomes increasingly difficult to follow and digest all relevant research.</p>
<p>James Yorke, who obviously has much more experience and a better overview on research then me, already raised a similar concern more than a year ago.</p>

<p>In this post I want to open-source a Shiny app I am planning to use to organize relevant research in the soccer analytics space. This tool can hopefully serve as a straight-forward tabular collection of research as well as a way to identify overlap between research topic, author and institution (via an interactive network chart).</p>
<center>
<p><a href="https://larsmaurath.shinyapps.io/soccer-analytics-library" target="_blank">Soccer Analytics Library</a></p>
</center>
<p>Find a few possible use cases below:</p>
<div id="find-all-research-on-xg-models" class="section level4">
<h4>Find all research on <em>xG models</em></h4>
<p>Clicking on any node filters the table below.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/2021-01-03-introducing-soccer-analytics-library_files/topic.gif" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="find-a-certain-paper-by-name-and-read-its-abstract" class="section level4">
<h4>Find a certain paper by name and read its abstract</h4>
<p>The search functionality of the table makes it easy to filter by name.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/2021-01-03-introducing-soccer-analytics-library_files/paper.gif" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="find-all-papers-by-a-certain-author" class="section level4">
<h4>Find all papers by a certain author</h4>
<p>The dropdown filter on the left allows us to filter the graph by author to get a quick overview of their publications and research interests.</p>
<p><img src="/portfolio/2021-01-03-introducing-soccer-analytics-library_files/author.gif" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="filter-for-research-published-between-2011-and-2015" class="section level4">
<h4>Filter for research published between 2011 and 2015</h4>
<p>By filtering by publication year we can observe changing research focus over time.</p>

</div>
<div id="contribute" class="section level2">
<h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>One person alone cannot possibly know and aggregate all relevant research. If you know a piece that is missing feel free to open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/larsmaurath/soccer-analytics-library" target="_blank">Github</a> and I will add it. Research should be publicly available (not behind a paywall) and introduce a new concept to the community (quality over quantity).</p>
</div>
<div id="customize" class="section level2">
<h2>Customize</h2>
<p>Another option to interact with this tool is to clone the project on Github to then run a customized version locally. Instead of showing the abstracts in the table you could add your own nodes. The data in the table could be for a different set of papers altogether or the graph nodes may aggregate by another variable.</p>
