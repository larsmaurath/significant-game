As many year-end Twitter threads have highlighted: 2020 was a great year for soccer analytics. New open-sourced data sets have enabled a new wave of amateur content, while ever more sophisticated research is published by clubs, data providers and universities around the world.

Having followed the space for a few years now it becomes increasingly difficult to follow and digest all relevant research. 

James Yorke, who obviously has much more experience and a better overview on research then me, already raised a similar concern more than a year ago.

In this post I want to open-source a Shiny app I am planning to use to organize relevant research in the soccer analytics space. This tool can hopefully serve as a straight-forward tabular collection of research as well as a way to identify overlap between research topic, author and institution (via an interactive network chart).

[Soccer Analytics Library](https://larsmaurath.shinyapps.io/soccer-analytics-library){target="_blank"}

Find a few possible use cases below:

#### Find all research on *xG models*

Clicking on any node filters the table below.

<br>

#### Find a certain paper by name and read its abstract

The search functionality of the table makes it easy to filter by name.

#### Find all papers by a certain author

The dropdown filter on the left allows us to filter the graph by author to get a quick overview of their publications and research interests.

#### Filter for research published between 2011 and 2015

By filtering by publication year we can observe changing research focus over time.

## Contribute

One person alone cannot possibly know and aggregate all relevant research. If you know a piece that is missing feel free to open an issue [on Github](https://github.com/larsmaurath/soccer-analytics-library){target="_blank"} with either the full information or at least the link, and I will add it. Research should be publicly available (not behind a paywall) and introduce a new concept to the community (quality over quantity).

## Contribute

Another option to interact with this tool is to clone the project on Github to then run a customized version locally. Instead of showing the abstracts in the table you could add your own nodes. The data in the table could be for a different set of papers altogether or the graph nodes may aggregate by another variable.
